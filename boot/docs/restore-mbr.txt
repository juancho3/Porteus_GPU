Restoring your Master Boot Record

If you have accidentally overwritten your Master Boot Record (MBR) by 
running Porteus Installer, lin_start_here.sh or win_start_here.hta 
on a partition holding another operating system then you may be able 
to recover it.

WINDOWS
This applies only if you tried to run win_start_here.hta against a 
C: drive containing a windows install. It also assumes the most common 
instance where windows is on the first hard drive.

Inside the /boot/tools/ folder in the Porteus .iso there is a utility 
called MbrFix.exe. This utility is used to make a backup of the first 
512 bytes of the first disk found, whenever win_start_here.hta is run. 
This backup, named mbr.bak, is placed on the root of the drive on 
which the win_start_here.hta script is run.

You can restore this backup to your drive's MBR by starting a command 
prompt as administrator, changing into the directory with MbrFix.exe 
(/boot/tools/) and running:

MbrFix /drive 0 restorembr ../mbr.bak

This utility has many other uses including rewriting a windows 
XP/Vista/7 MBR. You can see these other options by typing only 
MbrFix.exe

LINUX
If you installed your bootloader using the Porteus Installer, or if you
chose to backup the MBR while running lin_start_here.sh, then 
the first 512 bytes of the chosen partition was backed up on the root 
of the drive on which you ran the lin_start_here.sh script. You can 
restore the MBR by copying the MBR backup elsewhere and issuing the 
following from a console:

dd if=/path/to/mbr.bak of=/dev/sdx bs=512 count=1
(where sdx is the drive you are restoring).
