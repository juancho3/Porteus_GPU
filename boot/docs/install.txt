Introduction:
-----------------

Porteus is a linux distribution that runs live, without being 
'installed' natively like most other operating systems. Porteus creates 
its file system on the fly, within seconds, every time it is started 
up. This allows it to be run from many different kinds of media, 
including:

1)Writeable CD's or DVD's
2)USB Flash Drives (aka Pendrives)
3)External or Internal Hard Drives
4)Other writeable media, including flash cards, mp3 players, etc. 
(these installations are not covered by this Guide).

Porteus comes in the form of an ISO image file. An ISO file is an 
'image' of what should be on a CD/DVD. This file can be burned as a CD 
or DVD, or it can be mounted as a file system or upacked to gain 
access to the files for flash drive or hard drive installations. 
Burning the file to a CD is the easiest method of installation, but 
none of the changes you make (or files that you download) will be 
saved once the system is rebooted*. Installing Porteus to a flash 
drive or hard drive will allow you boot up more quickly, save changes 
to your flashdrive and add new files and programs easily.

*Note that changes to your system can be saved to external media when 
running Porteus (from a CD or otherwise), using the 'changes=' 
cheatcode, and specifying the path to the desired storage location. 
You can find more information on this and many other useful cheatcodes 
in the file /boot/docs/cheatcodes.txt.


Downloading Porteus
-----------------------

Porteus has two editions: 32-bit (i486) and 64-bit (x86_64). If you 
are running a 64-bit computer system, then you can download either 
edition. If you are running a 32-bit system, then you must download 
the 32-bit edition. Both editions can be downloaded by going to 
http://www.porteus.org, hovering over the 'Download' tab at the top 
of the webpage, and selecting your edition from the dropdown menu. You 
will be presented with an Index menu from our server. Click on 
"current", and then click on the porteus .iso file to download it.

Once your download is complete, you should also download the 
md5sums.txt file (from the same directory as the .iso file you just 
downloaded) and check to make sure the Md5 sum of your .iso file 
matches the Md5 sum listed in the md5sums.txt file. This will ensure 
that the .iso file was not corrupted while being downloaded. If your 
Md5 sum does not match, you should delete the .iso file and download 
it again, or Porteus may not run properly. If you do not already have 
software to check the Md5 Sum, you can use some freely available 
software, such as winMd5.

*******************************************
* Burning an ISO file to a CD or DVD Disk *
*******************************************

Most CD/DVD creation software has a function to 'burn an image to 
disk'. Please be aware that this is not the same as simply burning a 
file to disk or creating a 'data disk'. The end result should not be a 
disk that contains the .iso file, e.g. 'porteus-v1.1-i486.iso'. The 
end result should be a disk that contains two folders: one called 
'boot' and one called 'porteus'.

If your current CD/DVD creation software doesn't contain the function 
to 'burn an image to disk' then you can use some freely available 
software, such as imgburn.

Steps to install (varies by CD creation program):
----------------------------------------------------

1) Insert a blank writeable CD or DVD.

2) Start your CD/DVD creation software and select 'burn image' or 
'burn image to disk'

3) Navigate to and select the Porteus .iso file

4) Burn the file to the disk.

5) Check the CD to make sure it contains the 'boot' and 'porteus' 
folders.

6) Reboot your computer, leaving the disk in your computer.

In order for your computer to run Porteus from the CD, you must make 
sure that your BIOS is set to boot to your CDROM device first, before
booting to your hard disk. If you are unsure how to change the boot 
order in your BIOS, please see Appendix A.

*******************************************
* Installing Porteus to a USB Flash Drive *
*******************************************

As of Porteus Version 1.1, the officially supported method for 
installing Porteus to a flash drive or hard drive is to burn 
the ISO image to a CD following the instructions written above,
then boot Porteus from the CD and run the program 'Porteus Installer', 
which can be found in the KDE, LXDE or Xfce menu under the 'System'
heading.  This program detects the available devices attached 
to your system and automates the installation procedure.

Note that you must have an existing, formatted partition for this 
installation program to work.

If you would prefer to install without burning Porteus to a CD (either from
Windows or from a Linux OS), then you can accomplish this by manually 
extracting the ISO and executing the relevant script to install the 
bootloader of your choice.  To install using this method, please follow 
the instructions below:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| From Windows: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Porteus can be installed to a flash drive by copying the files from the 
.iso file to the flash drive and then making the drive bootable. 
Please note that you must be logged in as an administrator (or run the 
included 'win_start_here.hta' file with administrative priveleges) in 
order to make your drive bootable from Windows.

In order to install Porteus to a flash drive, you must first extract 
the porteus .iso file so that you can copy the included folders 
('boot' and 'porteus') to your flash drive. This can be done with 
archival software, similar to unzipping a .zip file. If your existing 
archival software cannot extract an .iso file, then try installing the 
free application 7zip or winrar. Once it is installed, you can right 
click on the .iso file, choose 7zip from the right-click menu (or, 
open winrar and navigate to the .iso's location), and select the option 
to extract the file.

(*NOTE* you can also use a program called wincdemu, which will allow 
you to double click on the .iso file and then access the folders 
inside it as if it were a CD mounted in your CD drive.)

If you have already created a bootable Porteus CD, you can also 
insert that CD and copy the files from there.

Steps to install:
---------------------

1) Insert your flash drive and open it to view the contents. Make a 
note of the Drive Letter assigned to this drive (e.g. E:\)

2) Copy the folders 'boot' and 'porteus' from the .iso file to the 
top-level directory of your flash drive (meaning the files should not 
be placed inside any other folders on the drive. For example, they 
should be located at E:\boot and E:\porteus, assuming your flash drive 
is device E:\).

3) Navigate into the boot folder that you just copied to your flash 
drive. You should see an HTML Application file there called 
win_start_here.hta. Right click on this file (make sure it is 
win_start_here.hta and not lin_start_here.sh) and choose to run it as 
an administrator. A window should appear with a menu.

4) If you are running the installer from Windows Vista or Windows 7 
(users of Windows XP and earlier versions can skip this step), you 
must disable the User Account Control (UAC) program or it will prevent 
you from writing to your flash drive's MBR. To simplify this task, an 
application called MyUAC has been included with our installer. In 
order to temporarily disable UAC, click on the "Disable UAC" button on 
the win_start_here.hta menu, then read the instructions and click on 
the "Deactivate UAC" button. Then, click "Yes" to reboot your computer 
to apply these settings. After your computer reboots into Windows, 
open the win_start_here.hta application again, and proceed with Step 5 
below to install your bootloader. Once your installation is complete, 
you can run the win_start_here.hta application again, click on the 
"Disable UAC" button once more, and then click on the "Activate UAC" 
button. This will turn UAC back on the next time you boot up Windows.

5) From the menu, select 'Install Porteus'.  A dialog box will open.  
Please read the information carefully, and be sure to confirm that 
the correct drive is being made bootable.  This is important as the 
installation program will write to the master boot record (MBR) on 
the first sector of the device from which the script is run. Your 
flash drive will not be made bootable if you write to the MBR of 
another device, and it could make it so that your computer will no 
longer boot to Windows (if this happens to you, please read the file 
\boot\docs\restore-mbr.txt inside the Porteus ISO for recovery 
instructions).  Press any key when you are done reading to complete 
the installation.

6) After running the installation program, you should be able to boot 
Porteus from your flash drive. Reboot your computer, and make sure 
that your BIOS is set to boot from the USB device first, before it 
boots to your hard disk. If you are unsure how to change the boot 
order in your BIOS, please see Appendix A.

*NOTE* If you are having problems making your drive bootable from 
within Windows or if you do not have administrative priveleges, try 
burning Porteus to a CD or DVD using the instructions above, and then 
either run the 'Porteus Installer' program (which can be found in the 
KDE, LXDE or Xfce menu under the 'System' heading) or follow the 
instructions below to install Porteus to a USB flash drive from within 
Linux.

*NOTE* If your flashdrive is formatted with a Windows filesystem (e.g. 
FAT or NTFS), none of the changes you make to your system will survive 
between reboots (Porteus will default to "Always Fresh" mode). If you 
would like to save your changes, you can create a '.dat' file 
container for this purpose. See Appendix B below for more information 
about this very important feature, which is required for saving your 
changes to a partition formatted with a Windows filesystem.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| From Linux: |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*PLEASE NOTE* If you experience problems when running the Porteus
installation scripts from your existing Linux distribution, please 
burn the Porteus ISO to a CD (see above instructions) and boot from 
that for the installation to USB. The method described below should 
work from most Linux distributions, but full compatibility with every 
distribution is not guaranteed. 

Installing Porteus through Linux is similar to installing through 
Windows. You must have root (super user) priveleges on your system in 
order to run the installation script.

Before installing, you must extract or mount the .iso file in order 
to copy the /boot and /porteus directories to your target device. Some 
archiving programs are capable of extracting the .iso, or you can 
simply mount it with the following commands:

mkdir /mnt/loop
mount -o loop /path/to/file.iso /mnt/loop

If you are using Porteus for this installation, you can simply enter:

mloop /path/to/file.iso

And you can then navigate to /mnt/loop to access the necessary files. 
If you are running from a Porteus CD, you can navigate to /mnt/sr0/ 
and copy the files from there.

Steps to Install:
---------------------

1) Insert your flash drive. If a window automatically pops up when 
you plug it in, click to open the device. This will mount your flash 
drive and you can see it's path by opening a console and typing:

mount

If the device is not mounted automatically, then you can open a 
console and type:

fdisk -l

to get the path of your flash drive (e.g., /dev/sdb1), and then:

mkdir /mnt/sdb1
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1

(substitute sdb1 with the name of your device if it was listed 
differently in fdisk)

Make note of the device's name, as this is the device which will need 
to be modified by a script later in the process.

2) Copy the files /boot and /porteus from the Porteus .iso file (or 
from a Porteus CD) to the root directory of your flash drive (meaning 
the files should not be placed inside any other folders on the drive. 
For example, they should be located at /mnt/sdb1/boot and 
/mnt/sdb1/porteus, assuming your flash drive is is mounted at 
/mnt/sdb1).

3) Open a console and change directories to the boot folder that you 
just copied into the flash drive, e.g.

cd /mnt/sdb1/boot

Execute the lin_start_here.sh script:

./lin_start_here.sh

*NOTE* If you are not running as root already, you must use the su or 
sudo command and enter your root password before starting this script, 
or it will not be able to configure your device properly.

*NOTE* Some modern linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, 
Mandriva, etc, use 'udisk' to automount usb drives from within 
KDE/Gnome/LXDE, etc. In versions higher than 1.0.2, udisk will not 
automount these drives with executable permissions (attempting to run 
the script will result in an error stating that permissions have been 
denied), and you must mount your device manually as root in order to 
execute the script. For example:

mkdir /tmp/media
mount /dev/sdXY /tmp/media
/tmp/media/boot/lin_start_here.sh

(where sdXY is the device and partition to which you are installing 
Porteus)


This script will bring up a menu.

4) From the menu, select the 'Install Porteus to...' option that 
matches the filesystem type of the drive to which you are installing. 
Most drives are formatted with a FAT filesystem at the factory, and 
should work with option number 5, "Install Porteus to a FATx or EXTx 
partition (extlinux)". If you have formatted your flash drive to NTFS 
or some other filesystem that is not compatible with extlinux, 
then use option number 6 to install LILO as your bootloader. LILO 
will work for any filesystem type, but it boots up with a text menu 
instead of a graphical menu like extlinux. Once you have selected 
your bootloader, follow the instructions given by the script from 
here, and be sure to confirm that the correct device is being made 
bootable. This is important as the script will write to the master 
boot record (MBR) on the first sector of the device from which the 
script is run. Your flash drive will not be made bootable if you 
write to the MBR of another device, and it could make it so that your 
computer will no longer boot (if this happens to you, please read the 
file located at /boot/docs/restore-mbr.txt in the Porteus ISO for 
recovery instructions). 

5) After running the install script, you should be able to boot 
Porteus from your flash drive. Reboot your computer, and make sure 
that your BIOS is set to boot from the USB device first, before it 
boots to your hard disk. If you are unsure how to change the boot 
order in your BIOS, please see Appendix A.

*NOTE* If your flashdrive is formatted with a Windows filesystem 
(e.g. FAT or NTFS), none of the changes you make to your system will 
survive between reboots (Porteus will default to "Always Fresh" mode). 
If you would like to save your changes, you can create a '.dat' file 
container for this purpose. See Appendix B below for more information 
about this very important feature, which is required for saving your 
changes to a partition formatted with a Windows filesystem.


*****************************************************
* Installations to Internal or External Hard Drives *
*****************************************************

Porteus can be installed to hard drives, but it should be left in its 
compressed state (otherwise known as a 'Frugal' installation). 
Installing extracted files to a hard drive is not supported; it is 
suggested that you install Slackware Linux instead if you wish to have 
an Operating System installed to your system natively.

Creating a 'Frugal' installation is very similar to installing on a 
USB drive. Porteus can be installed on it's own partition, or it can 
be installed side by side with Windows or another Linux OS on the same 
partition.

If Porteus is the only Operating System that you are installing to a 
device (internal or external), follow the instructions given above for 
burning the ISO to a CD and booting from it, and then run the 'Porteus 
Installer' program, which can be found in the KDE, LXDE or Xfce menu 
under the 'System' heading.

You can also follow the instructions to manually unpack the ISO to your
target drive and run the lin_start_here or win_start_here scripts as 
described in the "Install to USB" section.

For directions on installing Porteus to a device that will also run 
other operating systems, please visit the documentation section and/or 
the community forum at the Porteus website, at http://porteus.org. 
These installations are highly variable depending on whether or not 
Windows needs to be installed on the device, and on what bootloader 
is used for the system.

*NOTE* If your drive is formatted with a Windows filesystem (e.g. 
FAT or NTFS), none of the changes you make to your system will survive 
between reboots (Porteus will default to "Always Fresh" mode). If you 
would like to save your changes, you can create a '.dat' file 
container for this purpose. See Appendix B below for more information 
about this very important feature, which is required for saving your 
changes to a partition formatted with a Windows filesystem.

$ APPENDIX A: Configuring your boot settings in BIOS $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

In order to boot Porteus from a device other than your computer's 
hard drive, you must make sure that your BIOS is set to boot from that 
device before booting the first hard disk.

To enter the BIOS of your machine, you will need to press a particular 
key during your computer's startup procedure. The exact key varies 
from computer to computer, but is typically shown briefly during 
startup, and it is usually one of the following keys:
F1, F2, F12, Esc, Tab, etc.

Once you press the specified key, you will be shown the BIOS menu. 
While in BIOS, the legend for using the keyboard is at the bottom of 
the screen. Inside the BIOS menu, you should look for your 'boot 
order' option, and set your desired device (CDROM or USB device) to 
the top of the list. Once you have changed your boot order, press F10 
to save your changes and exit. If you are planning to boot to a USB 
device, make sure it is plugged in when you enter your BIOS, as some 
systems will only show the USB option when a USB device is present.

Many machines also have another key to press during startup that 
allows you to choose which device to boot from, without entering 
the BIOS. While this is very handy, at some stage you will probably 
want to change the BIOS setting so you don't have to keep pressing 
this button at every boot. Be aware if your machine contains sensitive 
data and is used by other people that leaving the setting to 'boot 
from USB' presents a security risk. Others could also plug in a device 
and boot to their own OS and access the information on your hard drive.

No Boot from USB in BIOS?
-------------------------

Don't panic just yet, you may still be able to boot from your USB 
device. Porteus contains a boot loader called Plop. Using this boot 
loader, you can plug in your USB device as well as a Porteus CD. Boot 
to the CD and when the Porteus menu comes up, highlight the Plop Boot 
Manager and press enter to start up Plop. Within Plop, you can select 
'USB', and press enter to boot from the USB device.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$ Appendix B - Saving changes to a Windows Filesystem $
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Porteus allows users to save their changes (i.e., system settings, 
downloaded files, bookmarks, browser history, etc) to a folder or 
image file (aka container) that exists outside of Porteus' core files. 
The 'changes=' cheatcode parameter sets the location for these 
changes. When you start Porteus with this cheatcode (enabled by 
default for USB installations), it will boot up the operating system 
and then apply your changes from this location. By default, Porteus is 
set to save these changes to /porteus/changes.

If you are installing Porteus to a device that is formatted with a 
Windows filesystem (e.g. FAT 32, NTFS, etc), you are required to use 
a '.dat' container for your changes. This container allows you to 
retain linux permissions and symlinks, which are necessary for your 
system to run properly and securely. 

While starting up, Porteus will run a check to see if you are asking 
it to save changes directly to a device with a Windows filesystem.  
If you are, then Porteus will boot without saved changes enabled.  To 
create a '.dat' container file and start saving your changes, boot 
Porteus into KDE, LXDE or Xfce.  Then open up the menu and navigate to 
"System -> Porteus save.dat manager" (NOTE:  You can also access this 
program through "Porteus Settings Centre", which will help you to
customize various settings, including creation of a save.dat).
Click on this application to open it, and click on the "Create" button. 
It will ask you for the name, size and location where you want to 
create it .  You can choose any name you like, for example, porteussave, 
save, mychanges, etc (upon creation, the .dat suffix will be added). 
You must then enter the size of the container in megabytes and a the
location on disk (e.g. /mnt/sdb1/porteus/, if sdb1 is your 
desired storage device), then click 'OK' and it will be created 
and placed on your storage device.  In order to start saving your changes, 
you will need to make a simple modification to the file that configures 
your bootup procedure.   The save.dat manager will walk you through 
these changes, but just in case, here are the necessary steps to 
peform this manually:

As root, open the file /boot/porteus.cfg. You will have several 
entries in this file, which look like this:

/**************************************************************/

LABEL xconf
MENU LABEL Graphics mode (KDE).
KERNEL /boot/vmlinuz
APPEND initrd=/boot/initrd.xz vga=791 changes=/porteus/
TEXT HELP
Run Porteus the best way we can.
Try to autoconfigure graphics
card and use the maximum
allowed resolution
ENDTEXT

LABEL lxde
MENU LABEL Graphics mode (LXDE).
KERNEL /boot/vmlinuz
APPEND initrd=/boot/initrd.xz vga=791 lxde changes=/porteus/
TEXT HELP
Run Porteus the same as above.
Lightweight LXDE to be
launched as default desktop
ENDTEXT

/**************************************************************/


You will need to edit the end of the APPEND line, to make it read 
'changes=/porteus/save.dat' (without the quotes, using the name you 
specified earlier). Save this file and upon reboot your changes 
will be saved to this container.

*NOTE* If you need to gain access directly to the files in your 
save.dat container (if, for example, you boot into 'Always Fresh' 
mode and need to remove or edit one of your saved files), you can 
mount the container on a loop, using these commands in a console:

mkdir /mnt/loop
mount -o loop /mnt/live/mnt/sdXN/save.dat /mnt/loop

where sdXN is the name of your device, e.g. sdb1.

You will then have access to these files, in /mnt/loop

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks for using Porteus!
